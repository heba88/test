- I have created a Java EE web application to solve this excercise.
- I have assumed that the URL represent a response from RESTful web service.
- Upon clicking server home url --> home page appears to the user to check offers
- User can filter results based on destination/ hotel rating/ price ... etc ==> these are passes as query parameter to the URL
- Upon receiving the JSON response, the code use Gson library to parse JSON objects to Java objects.
- The Java objects bean accessd from result JSP page to show retaturned offers.

Doing this project :
- I have learned building Java EE application using maven.
- I learned how to use GIT hub.
- I learned how to use Heroku.

Even if my delivered project may not meet all requirments, it was a great chance for me to learn new things and that was amazing. 

Thanks.
